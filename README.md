This code was part of my project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms class.

The project idea is to empirically analyze two different partitioning methods for Quickselect algorithm:
1- Lumoto Partitioning
2- Sedgewick Partitioning 

Using two different metrics:
1- Physical Runtime
2- Basic Operation Count

And by progressively increasing the lise size, we can finally see which one behaves better (hence the empirical analysis).

The list size can be changed in the .js file and all the calculations and results are dislpayed in the console.
